         &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Smart Notification is a function designed to keep you from being disturbed by excessive notifications,
             and also to extend your battery life. It intelligently detects whether you are interacting with the phone or not, and temporarily 
             block your notifications when you are not likely to check them by shutting down the radio.\n &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; Don\'t worry you won\'t lose any 
             notifications. The radio will be recovered automatically and blocked notifications will show up once you come back to the phone. </string>
